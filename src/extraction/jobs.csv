Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.  

  

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  

  

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

 **Job Description**  

Square’s purpose is economic empowerment; since the company’s beginning, we have been helping numerous people start and manage their own businesses. During the pandemic, many small businesses struggled, as they scramble to adapt to going online to reach their customers.


The Identity Platform team cultivates trusted relationships with Sellers and businesses across the globe and supports their growth by seamlessly connecting them to the Square ecosystem. We do this by providing authentication and authorization mechanisms and delivering solutions that safeguard access to data while providing account-lifecycle management and session security. We also provide platform solutions for onboarding Sellers to the ecosystem, which includes verification of identity and business data, regulatory screening, qualifying their activation for payment methods, and supporting identity management throughout the lifecycle with Square. We strive to build an Identity platform that empowers both teams at Square and an ecosystem of third party developers.


This is a critical responsibility with huge challenges. Our services are in the critical path and we have to approach our problems from a global perspective. We work with many stakeholder teams at Square while navigating compliance and regulatory needs alongside technical and product ambiguities. We are looking for someone who is passionate about building scalable, resilient and highly available systems and can help us continue to build out our Identity platform through its next evolution.

* Lead by example and foster a culture of positivity, psychological safety, and inclusivity within the team
* Provide mentorship and share technical expertise with other engineers

* Participate in an escalated ONCALL rotation for high impact SEVs


If you share our passion for this mission, and are eager to solve these complex challenges, please reach out to us!

 **Qualifications**  

You have:

* 12+ years of industry experience designing and building backend systems using Java or an equivalent language

* Experience leading complex technical projects, e.g. cross-team programs
* A strong sense of customer empathy and an interest in influencing the direction of a platform
* Excellent software engineering knowledge and the ability to provide technical mentorship and guidance.

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.  

  

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  

  

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

 **Job Description**  

Square’s purpose is economic empowerment; since the company’s beginning, we have been helping numerous people start and manage their own businesses. During the pandemic, many small businesses struggled, as they scramble to adapt to going online to reach their customers.


The Identity Platform team cultivates trusted relationships with Sellers and businesses across the globe and supports their growth by seamlessly connecting them to the Square ecosystem. We do this by providing authentication and authorization mechanisms and delivering solutions that safeguard access to data while providing account-lifecycle management and session security. We also provide platform solutions for onboarding Sellers to the ecosystem, which includes verification of identity and business data, regulatory screening, qualifying their activation for payment methods, and supporting identity management throughout the lifecycle with Square. We strive to build an Identity platform that empowers both teams at Square and an ecosystem of third party developers.


This is a critical responsibility with huge challenges. Our services are in the critical path and we have to approach our problems from a global perspective. We work with many stakeholder teams at Square while navigating compliance and regulatory needs alongside technical and product ambiguities. We are looking for someone who is passionate about building scalable, resilient and highly available systems and can help us continue to build out our Identity platform through its next evolution.


As a tech lead on the Identity Platform team, you will:

* Play a crucial role in strategic technical direction setting that supports our mission by influencing roadmaps, architectural considerations and platform cohesion.
* Raise the engineering excellence bar as it pertains to engineering practices, operational practices, and architecture/design reviews
* Drill in where there are problems (operations, SEVs, unblocking stuck teams, technical challenges) and foster a culture of improvement
* Oversee the delivery of strategic or complex initiatives by leading across teams and disciplines
* Lead by example and foster a culture of positivity, psychological safety, and inclusivity within the team
* Provide mentorship and share technical expertise with other engineers
* Help maintain and improve the processes we use to manage our work
* Participate in an escalated ONCALL rotation for high impact SEVs


If you share our passion for this mission, and are eager to solve these complex challenges, please reach out to us!

 **Qualifications**  

You have:

* 12+ years of industry experience designing and building backend systems using Java or an equivalent language
* A high degree of comfort and a track record of success in high-ambiguity problem spaces
* Experience or familiarity with OAuth specification for public API access
* A track record showing the design, execution, and successful long-term maintenance of complex distributed systems that require high throughput and reliability
* Experience with customer-facing identity solutions (authorization, authentication, verification, or onboarding workflows)
* Experience leading complex technical projects, e.g. cross-team programs
* A strong sense of customer empathy and an interest in influencing the direction of a platform
* Excellent software engineering knowledge and the ability to provide technical mentorship and guidance.


Technologies we use:

* Java / Ruby / GoLang / Guice / MySQL / DynamoDB / Protocol Buffers / gRPC / JUnit / jOOQ / Redis / Kafka / git / Bazel / Zookeeper / AWS / OAuth / Temporal

**Life at Abridge**
-------------------


At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.


Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

**Diversity & Inclusion**
-------------------------


Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

**Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.

As Uber Eats has grown from a restaurant only business to selling everything from groceries to flowers, our Catalog system has had to evolve significantly. Catalog Quality is critical to help:
* Make it easy for Customers to shop and have confidence in what they're purchasing
* Make it easy for Shoppers to locate, select, and deliver the correct products
* Make it easy for CPGs to advertise their products and have the best possible performance
* Make it easy for Merchants to understand performance and manage and grow their business

As Uber expands into Grocery and Retail, we need to build a massive product catalog that is highly accurate so that our customers have confidence in what they're buying, our shoppers accurately fulfill the right products, and merchants achieve the sales growth they are looking for. You will be responsible for partnering with global teams around the company to understand how the catalog can power each experience and develop a strategy to grow and enrich Uber's product catalog.
  

  

This is a representative sampling of the areas you might be tackling together with the team you're leading:
* Develop OKRs that drive towards defining, measuring, and achieving a more comprehensive and accurate catalog
* Identify and prioritize new product attributes that we should be collecting to power various use cases in the experience
* Uncover new sources for product catalog data and develop strategies to reconcile and integrate these diverse sources effectively
* Work with Uber AI to explore ML & LLM's to curate the product catalog
* Partner with Ops to design and implement scalable human-in-the-loop processes for auditing and enhancing the accuracy of the product catalog
* Power intelligent user experiences by accurately identifying billions of products globally and mapping the intricate relationships between them.

**Basic Qualifications*** Minimum 3 years experience delivering successful and innovative products with your fingerprints all over them

**Preferred Qualifications*** + Technical savviness. Can manifest in different ways: a computer science undergraduate degree, hands-on software engineering experience, or experiences building complex software products side by side with engineers.
	+ Attention to detail. The ability to obsess over every single part of the retailing process
	+ Customer obsession. The ability to take on complex product challenges and find elegant, simplifying solutions to avoid making them our users and partner's problems
	+ Finger-tippiness with data. You find a way to get the data you need and whip it into an insightful story with no help. You know how to leverage this data to make decisions without getting stuck in analysis paralysis
	+ Grittiness. You never hesitate to roll up your sleeves and tackle something hands-on
	+ A high bar across the board - from your own contributions to the people you work with, to the products you work on
	+ A true passion for Uber's mission, our products, and the company's hybrid technology/operations nature
	+ A never-ending desire to grow and learn
	E-Commerce, Grocery, and/or Retail Catalog and/or Inventory management Experience. You would have directly built products to support product catalogs or inventory management systems.

We build distributed systems that are partially or entirely powered by AI and ML. The system will be responsible for scaling the discovery of Product Knowledge by mining customer engagements (e.g. search queries, customer reviews etc.)
  
  

Our Mission
  
Enable customer shopping journeys on Amazon by modeling an authoritative, standardized, semantically rich, easily discoverable, extensible, and universally applicable body of product knowledge that can be consistently utilized across customer shopping experiences, selling partner listing experiences and internal enrichment of product data.

You will innovate day-in and day-out, beyond the ""textbook solutions"".
  
  

This is a great opportunity for engineers who want to work with latest AI technologies, and create reliable and scalable solutions that enable Amazon to create the largest and best possible selection for our customers. Come and help make history as we take e-Commerce to the 5 billion people on earth who do not have it today while having fun and learning a lot on the way!

**Life at Abridge** 

 At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.
 



 Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.
 


**Diversity & Inclusion** 

 Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).
 


**Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud** 

 We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.

 Location: New York, NY (Hybrid, 3 days a week at the office)
   

 Duration: 6+ Months
   

 Implementation Partner: Blue.cloud
   

 End Client: To be disclosed
 




 About the Role:
 

  

 We're looking for talented developers with a passion for designing, building, deploying, and supporting large-scale systems in a rapidly-moving environment.
 

 Equity Derivatives Technology is undergoing a large transformation project to entirely refresh our platforms for large-scale compute, global data services, pricing, and risk and PnL production. We need experienced developers to help build out these services as we grow the new platform to fulfill our regulatory commitments and power business growth, especially in the structured products space.
 

 The candidate will work on primarily new services, using modern Java on the server side, across our internal cloud and external clouds. Although the role is development-focused, teams are expected to fully support their own applications, including deployment, release management, and user support, all the way to production. As such, this role includes providing a follow-the-sun support model globally for the new Risk services stack in conjunction with the other regional teams in Equities technology.
 

 This role is focused on building out an event-based infrastructure to rework many of our core flows, moving us towards a real-time-by-default environment. You will build, on top of popular open-source data processing frameworks (including but not limited to Apache Kafka), use-cases such as:
 
* Staging and aggregating billions of regulatory risk result objects each day to send to our Front-to-Back data stores.
* Implementing processing, storage, and service functions for different classes of risk data, pricing inputs, and reference data to provide a universal real-time intraday capability for application clients.
* Promoting, where appropriate, the benefits of event-sourcing architectures and an event-first approach to design.



 Your Skills and Experience:
 

  

 You're an experienced server-side developer with a technical background. You should be able to demonstrate problem-solving ability and be comfortable working in an agile environment with rapid release cycles. The focus will be on developing greenfield services to level up our platform. Roles are full-service, with developers expected to build, test, deploy, and support their products within a global team.
 

 You will ideally have experience with application architectures that take advantage of cloud deployment, offering additional flexibility to reduce downtime and maintenance overhead, respond to changing demand, and optimize cost.
 



 Essential Skills:
 
* Must be able to lead a team of developers and manage a book of work in conjunction with IT management and business customers.
* Extensive experience with server-side development on top of the Java Virtual Machine.
* Modern Java expertise (version 8 and up, we use 17 for new projects).
* Experience working in agile (SCRUM-related) cycles and coordination with multiple teams of developers and users.
* Knowledge of Continuous Integration products such as TeamCity and Jenkins.
* Solid knowledge of Git version control, and workflows around it.
* Knowledge of distributed systems.



 Highly Advantageous:
 
* Experience working with Equity Derivatives products and systems.
* Knowledge of public cloud infrastructure such as GCP (preferred), AWS, Azure.
* Experience working in financial institutions and regulated IT environments.
* Python development/scripting.","","","","","","","","","",""

 Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.
 



 The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.
 



 Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:
 


* We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
* We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
* We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.



 Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.
 



 Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Singapore, and India.

 EliseAI develops cutting-edge conversational AI technology for industries fundamental to our lives: housing and healthcare. Everything is built on the foundation of health and home. Broken systems or ineffective processes in these domains have a disproportionate impact on our quality of life and society's overall wellbeing. Conversely, any solution or technology that solves problems in these areas will have an impact that ripples far beyond them. That's the only kind of impact we are interested in having at EliseAI.

* Design, develop, and maintain robust and scalable APIs. Ensure that our APIs are optimized for performance, security, and scalability.


  

**What we're seeking:**

The tech industry hasn't pulled its weight in solving the problems faced by low-income Americans.
   

  

 Propel's mission is to change that. We've built Providers, the single most popular app in the country built specifically for low-income Americans. Over 5 million families each month use Providers to seamlessly manage their government benefits (programs like SNAP, commonly known as food stamps), conduct their banking, and save and earn money. Providers has been recognized by the White House, featured on the front page of the NYTimes, and carries over 500,000 five star reviews.
   

  

 Propel is a for-profit, venture-backed start-up company that holds its social mission at its core. We're proud to be supported by a blend of nonprofits, impact investors, and world-class investors, including the Robin Hood Foundation, Andreessen Horowitz, Nyca Partners, Financial Health Network, JPMorganChase, Kevin Durant, Serena Williams, and Nas. For us to build a self-sustaining and profitable business, we need to deeply understand our user's needs and build multiple successful products addressing those needs. If this challenge appeals to you, we'd love to talk!

 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
   

  

 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
   

  

 Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
   

**About The Role:** 
  

  

 Notion is looking for talented engineers to join our search team. This team is responsible for ensuring that, wherever in the application our users need to find documents, they'll get back the most relevant ones, as quickly as possible. You will delight our users by helping define and improve our approach to full-text indexing, retrieval, ranking, personalization and semantic searching.
   

**What You'll Achieve:** 
  

* You'll build best-in-class search and retrieval systems used by millions of users across billions of documents
* You'll improve search relevancy using creative, cutting-edge techniques from both industry and new research
* You'll ensure the reliability and correctness of our distributed real-time indexing pipeline, indexing every change made to every document in all of Notion
* You'll find ways, big and small, to leverage AI and LLMs to help users find the most important and relevant information in their Notion workspaces
* You'll collaborate with product engineers across Notion to provide search functionality in their product features.


**Skills You'll Need to Bring:** 
  

* You have experience in:
	+ backend engineering;
	+ data infrastructure;
	+ search infrastructure;
	+ natural language processing, or
	+ machine learning for ranking / classification
* You have a track record for shipping scalable and reliable user-facing products
* You thrive when collaborating cross-functionally - especially with product, design, infrastructure or data teams
* You have a computer science background or equivalent technical experience


**Nice to Haves:** 
  

* You have experience building full-text search using, e.g: Lucene, Elasticsearch, Solr
* You have experience building fully productionized machine learning systems
* You have experience with designing, building and maintaining complex distributed systems
* You have experience with large scale data processing technologies, e.g: Spark, Flink, Kafka, Airflow, YARN/Hadoop
* You have implemented semantic search systems
* You have worked at a fast-growing start-up, a SaaS company, or are eager to contribute in such an environment (being a current Notion user would be great!)
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others-and understand why we're big fans of their work.


  

  

 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you're excited about a role but your past experience doesn't align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you're a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
   

  

 Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation made due to a disability, please let your recruiter know. Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits.

The model affords an exceptional, groundbreaking opportunity to change the life paths of our most vulnerable, at-risk children and tackle the achievement gap before it begins.  This unique public-private partnership brings together the NYC Department of Education (DOE), NYC Administration for Children Services (ACS), SCO Family of Services, and a wide range of local organizations shaping the Leadership Institute for current and aspiring Directors.  FirstStepNYC, a demonstration project with an emphasis on both early childhood and adult leadership development, will advance citywide efforts to ensure all children enter kindergarten on a path to be college and career ready by the time they graduate our schools.
 



 NYC will draw from the rigorously evaluated national model, Educare.  Developed and supported by the Educare Learning Network, a partnership between the Ounce of Prevention Fund and The Buffet Early Childhood Fund, the Educare model has shown to be effective in preparing at-risk children for school and keeping parents/caregivers involved through elementary school.
